In this assignment We need to create a computer program that uses pictures to find a type of cancer called melanoma. Melanoma can be very dangerous if not found early. It causes most of the deaths from skin cancer. If we can make a program that looks at pictures and tells doctors when melanoma might be present, it could save a lot of time and effort in diagnosing the disease.
